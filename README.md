# Data Analysis Projects Repository 📊

Welcome to my data analysis projects repository! 🚀

In this repository, you will find a constantly growing collection of my projects related to data analysis and visualization. From exploratory analysis to creating impactful visualizations, this folder reflects my passion for extracting valuable insights from data. 🌟

## Objective 🎯

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a record of my work in data analysis. Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data manipulation and visualization, as well as my ability to draw meaningful conclusions from them.

## Contents 📚

The projects presented here cover various areas of data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis. Each project is carefully documented and accompanied by clear and concise visualizations.

Each project folder contains two essential files:

1. **HTML Preview**: Inside each project folder, you'll find a file named after the project's repository. This file serves as a direct link to the project's repository, where you can view the analysis in HTML format along with the accompanying data files.
   - Example: [View Project Repository](https://github.com/LPintos14/Data_Analitycs_Projects)

2. **Direct Link**: Additionally, you'll find a file named `direct_link.txt`. This file contains a direct link that you can simply click to access the project instantly.
